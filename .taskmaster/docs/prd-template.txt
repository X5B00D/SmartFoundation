## Notes for Task Master AI

When you parse this PRD with Task Master AI, it will:
1. Analyze the content and complexity
2. Generate appropriate number of tasks based on project scope
3. Break down phases into actionable tasks
4. Set dependencies between related tasks
5. Assign priorities based on implementation phases

**Tips for better task generation:**
- Be specific about technical requirements
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Mention dependencies between features
- Specify testing requirements
- Provide implementation details where possible
